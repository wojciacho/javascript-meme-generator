# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is a meme generator.
In this project I used the fetch method to request data from a server.
* Server I used: https://meme-api.com/gimme/
* Documentation: https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api

To use this app just click on button and generated meme will be displayed on the screen.
